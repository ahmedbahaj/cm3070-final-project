# Benchmarking Deep Learning Techniques for Accurate Classification of Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathology

**Final Project for BSc in Computer Science at Goldsmiths, University of London**

---

## Overview

This repository contains my graduation project focusing on the classification of histopathological images using twelve diverse deep learning models. Leveraging the LC25000 dataset, this project compares various CNN architectures, hybrid models, and advanced architectures to evaluate their effectiveness in identifying different cancer types.

## Models Implemented

The repository includes comprehensive implementations and performance benchmarks for the following models:

### Classical CNN Architectures
- Customized CNN
- VGG16
- ResNet50
- ResNeXt50 (Custom Implementation)
- DenseNet169

### Efficient and Lightweight Models
- MobileNet
- EfficientNetB0
- NASNetMobile

### Inception-based Architectures
- InceptionV3
- Xception

### Hybrid and Specialized Architectures
- CNN + LSTM
- Capsule Network (CapsNet)
